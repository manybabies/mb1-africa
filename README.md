This repository contains the data and code for the project ManyBabies 1: Infant-Directed Speech Preference.
Materials related to the project can be found on OSF: https://osf.io/re95x/
General information on ManyBabies, including an overview of current projects, can be found on the project website: http://manybabies.stanford.edu

## Reproducibility

The files in this directory generate the main dataset from the individual datafiles, they should be run in numerical order to regenerate the (cached) processed data. The `paper` directory then contains the `.Rmd` to generate the manuscript. Note that a number of minor changes were introduced during copy editing and hence not every line will be identical between the published paper and the manuscript generated via these changes. 

## Follow-up analyses

The data and code are licensed for re-use. To coordinate with other interested parties, we suggest following the three steps.

1. Identify the research question you want to pursue. If you are not sure whether the dataset contains the information you would need or whether the relevant analysis is already in the works, feel free to email manybabies-gb@mailman.stanford.edu to ask about it.

2. Compose a brief email to send to the ManyBabies list (manybabies1@lists.stanford.edu) explaining your idea, and provide a mechanism for other ManyBabies1 contributors to sign up/express interest. Be sure to describe what kinds of contributions you are looking for. If there are particular skill-sets you are especially looking for, itâ€™s a good idea to mention these in the email.

3. Make sure you communicate clearly about what constitutes authorship level contribution (and how authorship will be structured) and expected timelines for completion of the project. This can evolve as the project does, as long as there is agreement and clarity.
