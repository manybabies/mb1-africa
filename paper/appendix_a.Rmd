# Discrepancies between pre-registration and final analyses  

1. **ICC comparison**  
   *Pre-registration:* We planned to compare the estimated ICC in our study with the ICC reported in MB1(B).
   
   *Final:* This comparison was not conducted because MB1(B) did not report ICC values.  

2. **Metrics of effect heterogeneity**  
   *Pre-registration:* We planned to report distributional metrics describing heterogeneity across labs (Mathur & VanderWeele, 2019, in press) using the *MetaUtility* package. Specifically, we proposed to estimate: (1) the percentage of effects greater than 0, (2) the percentage greater than Cohen’s d = 0.2, and (3) the percentage less than d = –0.2. These metrics were to be reported only if random slopes of trial type by lab were included in the final model, their variance was estimated as greater than 0, and at least 10 labs contributed data.  
   *Final:* Random slopes of trial type by lab were not included in the final model, and only six labs contributed data. As a result, we did not estimate these metrics.

3. **Subset of MB1 and MB1(B) data**  
   *Pre-registration:* We planned to subset MB1 and MB1(B) data to include only infants tested with central fixation procedures and infants not exposed to North American English (NAE), to maximize comparability with the present study.  
   *Final:* In MB1 and MB1(B) data, information about English exposure often did not distinguish between American and British English. Therefore, we excluded infants based on country of residence (United States/Canada) rather than reported language exposure. 
   
4. **Urban–rural exploratory analysis**  
   *Pre-registration:* We planned an exploratory analysis testing whether infants’ IDS preference differed between urban and rural areas, motivated by prior findings of differences in parental speech input across these contexts (e.g., Keller, 2012; Vogh et al., 2015).  
   *Final:* We did not collect information on urban versus rural residence, so this analysis was not conducted.  

5. **Socioeconomic status (SES) analyses**  
   *Pre-registration:* We planned to measure SES using both mothers’ years of formal education and the MacArthur Scale of Subjective Social Status (MacSSS), including both variables in regression models.  
   *Final:* We did not have MacSSS data for most participants, and information on mothers’ education was incomplete. We therefore used primary caregiver education as the main SES variable and conducted a robustness check using the subset of infant whose primary caregiver's sex is female.
